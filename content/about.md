Hi,  
I'm Abdel, also known as Uncaged Coder.  
Don't set your expectations too high for this blog; it serves as a space for me to share my thoughts on a variety of subjects. The focus is primarily on Linux, open-source projects, and other geek-related topics.  
This blog is powered by [**blogdown**](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown).
